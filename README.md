# HW_Hadasim
This project presents two exercises that I had to do as part of the "Hadassim" program homework
- First exercise - Twitter towers
- Second exercise - a system for managing the Corona database for health funds

## Twitter towers
In the Twitter towers project I performed the necessary tasks.
Next to the user I presented a menu explaining exactly what he should click, according to his choice.
The appropriate output according to the system requirements will be displayed.
For each output there is a short explanation of what it displays.

## Covid 19 managment
In the Corona management system, the exercise is divided into two tasks:
### Part 1:
In the first exercise it was necessary to establish a database-based system, a server side and a link between them.
I implemented the most basic system, which retrieves and enters data into the database.
I only referred to the members table.
For the other tables you can perform the same function, you just need to change the parameters and the query to retrieve the desired data.
* I attached the database file (Covid.19_DB.accdb) to the project on GitHub, you can download it and the code will run well.

### Part 2:
In the second part of the exercise it was necessary to create an RR document and also a test document for the presented characterization.
I have attached the documents to the project.
